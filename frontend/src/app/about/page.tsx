      <p>
        CEYLARA began as a studio in Mumbai crafting small-batch capsules for
        contemporary women seeking balance between tradition and global minimalism.
        We partner with ethical ateliers across India and the Middle East to
        produce dresses, abayas, sarees, and separates in breathable fabrics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every collection is informed by architectural lines, artisanal dyeing,
        and multi-cultural storytelling. We obsess over fit and functionality so
        that you can transition from weekday meetings to weekend rituals with
        confidence.
